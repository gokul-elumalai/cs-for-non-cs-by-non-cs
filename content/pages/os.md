Title: OS

## Introduction 

Here we'll see how user interacts with the hardware through Operating System.
Operating system provides an environment for users to execute programs.
It helps to manage the hardware.

OS does
### Process management
A program in execution is a process.  A process can have subprocesses. A process needs resources such as
CPU time, memory and I/O devices.

### Memory management
Memory is a large array of bytes in range of billions. In order to use a computer several programs
are needed to be kept in the memory, OS does
1. Allocation and deallocation of memory space
2. Decides which processes and data to keep in the memory
3. Tracks which part of the memory is used and who is using it.

### Storage management
OS creates an abstraction from physical storage devices to a logical unit, the file.

It has the following subdivisions

#### File-system management
A file is a collection of related information. OS helps in creating, deleting and managing files and
directories for organizing files. It also helps in backing up files to a nonvolatile device like hard disk.
#### Mass-storage management
#### Caching
#### I/O systems
