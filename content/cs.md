Summary: Describes essential computer science topics to be aware of for programmers.

This is a list of core Computer Science topics to be aware of to build good applications.

## Discrete Mathematics

Having a good understanding of mathematics will help understand the workings of
various data structures and analyzing its complexities.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Knowledge of which data structure and algorithm to use for a particular problem will
significantly reduce it complexities.

## Data Base Management System

It is a software that manages the data for us, unlike normal file system it provides features 
like consistency, security, quick access and search, preventing redundancy etc.

## Operating System

It is a software that talks to the hardware, knowledge of OS like threads, dead locks etc
will help us create fault tolerant applications.

## Networks

Solid knowledge of Computer networks is required to build web applications, we need to have
understanding of networking concepts to build secure applications.

## Computer Organization

Basic understanding of how computers are build and how memory works, will help us understand how
data will be stored in the memory, difference between `int` and `float` in terms of memory allocation.
